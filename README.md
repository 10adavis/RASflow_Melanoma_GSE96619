## Snakemake environment setup
Install miniconda and set up Snakemake environment according to Snakemake Tutorial.

To be brief, after installing miniconda, use the following command to create an environment that Snakemake will be working in:
conda env create --name snakemake-env --file environment.yaml

Then activate the environment:
source activate snakemake-env

Then you're ready to go!

Note: The environment for our RNA-Seq Snakemake can be found in the folder configs/.
